# Pokemon Analysis
This is a personal project I did to analyse the Pokemon dataset that I found on Kaggle. In this project, I aimed to answer the following: <br>
<ul>
<li>Which generation has the strongest and weakest Pokemon?</li>
<li>What Pokemon type is the strongest and the weakest?</li>
</ul>

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon)
